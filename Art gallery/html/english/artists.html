                  <p class="card-text">
                    Salvador Dalí, born on May 11, 1904, in Figueres, Spain, was a prominent Spanish surrealist artist.
                    Known for his imaginative and eccentric style, Dalí's artwork was often characterized by dreamlike imagery, 
                    melting clocks, and bizarre combinations of objects. He gained international recognition in the 1930s and 
                    became one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Dalí's artistic career spanned various mediums, 
                    including painting, sculpture, film, and photography. His contributions to surrealism challenged traditional artistic 
                    norms and pushed the boundaries of imagination and creativity. Throughout his life, Dalí's eccentric personality and 
                    flamboyant public persona added to his fame. He passed away on January 23, 1989, leaving behind a legacy of 
                    innovative and thought-provoking artworks that continue to captivate audiences worldwide.

                  <p class="card-text">Vincent van Gogh, born on March 30, 1853, in Zundert, Netherlands, 
                    was a highly influential post-impressionist painter. Despite struggling with mental health 
                    issues throughout his life, van Gogh created a vast body of work characterized by bold colors, 
                    expressive brushstrokes, and emotional intensity. His iconic paintings, such as "Starry Night" 
                    and "Sunflowers," continue to captivate audiences worldwide. Van Gogh's artistic journey was 
                    marked by experimentation and a relentless pursuit of capturing the essence of nature and human 
                    emotions on canvas. Despite facing financial difficulties and personal challenges, he remained 
                    dedicated to his craft. Tragically, van Gogh's life was cut short when he died by suicide on July 
                    29, 1890, at the age of 37. Today, his art is celebrated for its profound impact on the art world, 
                    inspiring generations of artists and admirers alike.</p>

                    Spanish artist who had a profound and enduring impact on the art world. Considered one of the pioneers 
                    of modern art, Picasso's work spanned various styles and movements, including cubism, surrealism, and 
                    abstract art. His innovative approach to art challenged traditional conventions and pushed the boundaries 
                    of creativity. Picasso's immense talent and versatility allowed him to excel in painting, sculpture, 
                    ceramics, and even poetry. His iconic works, such as "Guernica" and "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon," remain 
                    iconic symbols of artistic expression and political commentary. Picasso's artistic journey and prolific 
                    output continue to inspire and influence artists to this day. He passed away on April 8, 1973, leaving 
                    behind an extraordinary legacy that forever changed the course of modern art.</p>

                  the monumental David and the exquisite Pietà, showcase his ability to breathe life into marble and evoke profound 
                  emotions. As a painter, his masterpiece, the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, is a testament to his unparalleled 
                  skill and creativity. Michelangelo's architectural achievements, such as the majestic dome of St. Peter's Basilica, 
                  solidify his status as one of history's greatest artists. His unparalleled legacy continues to inspire and awe

                emotion. Despite facing early struggles in his artistic career, Rodin's breakthrough came in 1880 with his masterpiece 
                "The Gates of Hell." He went on to create iconic sculptures such as "The Thinker" and "The Kiss," solidifying his 
                reputation as one of the greatest sculptors of all time. Rodin's work pushed the boundaries of traditional sculpture 
                and had a profound impact on modern art. He passed away on November 17, 1917, leaving behind a vast body of work that
